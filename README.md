The game: "Furry collects coins". 
The protagonist of this game is Furry, who moves around the board with the size of 10x10 fields.

There is a coin on the random field of the board. The player controlling Furrym with the help of arrows. When he does, the field is also random, and the player takes 1 point.
When a player hits the wall, the game ends and is showing the alert with the inscription: Game over.

To programming that game, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScipt (like constructor function, move with arrow).
